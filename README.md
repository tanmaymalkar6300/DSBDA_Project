Analyzing Selling Price of Used Cars using Python

Team Members:
* Tanmay Malkar
* Harshvardhan Patil

Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing the selling price of used cars using Python. We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of used cars and develop a Machine Learning Model to predict the selling price based on various features.

Objectives:
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the key factors influencing the selling price.
* Visualize important trends and correlations in the dataset.
* Build an appropriate Machine Learning Model to predict the price of used cars.
* Compare different ML algorithms to determine the best-performing model.


Feature Description:
* Car Name: The name of the car model.
* Year: The year when the car was manufactured.
* Selling Price: The price at which the car was sold.
* Present Price: The current market price of the car.
* Kms Driven: Total kilometers driven by the car.
* Fuel Type: Type of fuel used (Petrol/Diesel/CNG).
* Seller Type: Whether the seller is an individual or a dealer.
* Transmission: Manual or Automatic.
* Owner: Number of previous owners.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We conducted an in-depth EDA which includes:
* Handling missing values and outliers.
* Visualizing price trends based on car features.
* Correlation analysis to understand feature importance.
* Distribution of key attributes like fuel type, transmission, and seller type.

Machine Learning Models Used:
We experimented with multiple ML algorithms:
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regressor
3. Random Forest Regressor
4. Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
5. Extra Trees Regressor (Best performing model)

Conclusion:
* Brand and Year significantly impact the selling price.
* Owner history and mileage play a crucial role in determining resale value.
* Fuel type and transmission also influence pricing trends.
* Extra Trees Regressor performed the best in terms of accuracy and model performance.

Future Enhancements:
* Adding deep learning models for better predictions.
* Integrating real-time price prediction for new listings.
* Expanding dataset for better generalization.
